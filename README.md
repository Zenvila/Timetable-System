## 🎯 Project Purpose

Managing class schedules via PDFs can be very tedious for students. Often, students have to scroll through long documents just to find their weekly class schedules. This project aims to eliminate that hassle by providing a digital, **web-based Timetable Management System**.

We propose a system with **two interfaces**:

### 👤 Student Interface
- Students can **enter their roll number** and view their personalized timetable.
- Features include:
  - Search by **Time**
  - Search by **Day**
  - Search by **Class**

### 🛠️ Admin Interface
- Admin has control over the system and can:
  - Add/Edit/Delete students
  - Manage teachers, courses, rooms, and schedules
  - Configure overall timetable data
